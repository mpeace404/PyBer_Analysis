# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis

### Purpose

After analyzing the Pyber data to determine fare and driver data for the 3 city types (Rural, Urban, and Suburban), V. Isualize requested a ride sharing summary chart by city type, and a line chart displaying the weekly fares from each city type for the months of Jan-Apr. 


## Results

* While Rural city types have the least amount of drivers and total rides, the average fare per ride ($34.62) and per driver ($55.49) are much higher than the suburban and urban city types
* Suburban city types see fewer than half of the total rides of urban areas (625) and have far less drivers (490), but the average fares per ride and per driver are less than rural city types
* Urban city types have the highest total rides, total drivers, and amount of total fares in USD ($39,854.38), however the average fare per ride and per driver are considerably lower than both suburban and rural city types

* Fares are relatively consistent per city type by week through the months of January-April, there are no remarkable peaks of activity for this time period

## Summary

Recommendations based on analysis:

* Rural areas do not use Pyber as frequently as urban or suburban city types, however they do travel further to their destinations. Rural riders could be increased by offering incentives such as discounts on rides over a certain mileage or dollar amount, or additional advertising in those areas to increase awareness of the convenience of using Pyber when traveling to the city.
*  Suburban riders do not travel as far to the city as rural riders, nor as frequently as urban riders. A PyberPool option may increase riders by offering a daily carpooling service for those that work in the city
*  Urban riders are by far the largest and most frequent users of Pyber, introducing a frequent rider program that gives points based on dollar amount spent would keep customer loyalty. Points could be redeemed for free rides, discounts on sister services such as PyberEats, or upgrades to the type of Pyber car for their ride.
